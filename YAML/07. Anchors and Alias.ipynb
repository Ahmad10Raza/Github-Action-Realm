    "In YAML, anchors are a feature that allows you to reuse a complex data structure by giving it a name (anchor) and then referencing that anchor elsewhere in the document. Anchors are particularly useful when you want to avoid duplicating large or nested data structures and maintain more maintainable and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) YAML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for defining an anchor is to prepend an ampersand (`&`) followed by the anchor name to the YAML element you want to anchor. You can then reference that anchor later in the document using an asterisk (`*`) followed by the anchor name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate anchors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Defining an anchor for a sequence\n",
    "fruits_list: &fruit_anchor\n",
    "  - apple\n",
    "  - banana\n",
    "  - orange\n",
    "\n",
    "# Referencing the anchor in a mapping\n",
    "person:\n",
    "  name: John Doe\n",
    "  favorite_fruits: *fruit_anchor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `&fruit_anchor` is the anchor for the sequence of fruits.\n",
    "- `*fruit_anchor` is used to reference the anchored sequence within the `favorite_fruits` key in the `person` mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about anchors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Global Scope:**\n",
    "   - Anchors are global in scope within a YAML document, meaning they can be referenced from anywhere below the point where they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reuse of Data:**\n",
    "   - Anchors allow you to reuse complex data structures without duplicating them. This is especially useful for large configurations or nested structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reference Syntax:**\n",
    "   - To reference an anchor, use the `*` symbol followed by the anchor name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple References:**\n",
    "   - You can reference the same anchor multiple times throughout the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Reusing the anchor in another context\n",
    "animals:\n",
    "  pets: *fruit_anchor\n",
    "  wild: *fruit_anchor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Anchors in Mappings:**\n",
    "   - Anchors can be applied to both sequences and mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Defining an anchor for a mapping\n",
    "person_data: &person_anchor\n",
    "  name: John Doe\n",
    "  age: 30\n",
    "\n",
    "# Referencing the anchor in a sequence\n",
    "people:\n",
    "  - *person_anchor\n",
    "  - name: Jane Smith\n",
    "    age: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `&person_anchor` is the anchor for a mapping, and it is referenced within a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchors are a powerful feature in YAML that helps improve the maintainability and readability of documents by promoting the reuse of data structures. They are particularly handy in scenarios where you need to avoid redundancy and ensure consistency across a YAML file."

    "In YAML, an alias is a feature that allows you to reuse a node (a scalar, sequence, or mapping) within the same YAML document. Unlike anchors, which are used to name and reference complex data structures, aliases are used to refer to a specific node and its value.\n",

    "The basic syntax for creating an alias is to prepend an asterisk (`*`) followed by the alias name to the YAML node you want to alias. You can then reference that alias elsewhere in the document by using the same alias name preceded by an ampersand (`&`).\n",
