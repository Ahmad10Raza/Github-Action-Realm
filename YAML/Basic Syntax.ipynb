    "In YAML, key-value pairs are fundamental components used to represent data. A key-value pair consists of two parts: a key and a corresponding value. These pairs are used to structure and organize data within a YAML document. Here's a breakdown of key aspects related to key-value pairs in YAML:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key:**\n",
    "   - The key is a string that represents a name or identifier associated with a value.\n",
    "   - Keys are case-sensitive.\n",
    "   - Keys are followed by a colon (`:`) and are placed at the beginning of a line, followed by the corresponding value.\n",
    "   - Keys should not be quoted unless they contain special characters (e.g., spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Value:**\n",
    "   - The value is the data associated with a specific key.\n",
    "   - Values can be of various types, including:\n",
    "      - Scalars: Strings, numbers, booleans, etc.\n",
    "      - Sequences: Arrays or lists.\n",
    "      - Mappings: Key-value pairs or dictionaries.\n",
    "   - Values can be expressed in different styles, such as block style or flow style.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Syntax:**\n",
    "   - Key-value pairs in YAML have a simple and clean syntax. Here's a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     key: value\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Indentation is crucial in YAML to denote the nesting of values. Nested structures are created by indenting the lines further.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example:**\n",
    "   - Here's an example YAML document with multiple key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     name: John Doe\n",
    "     age: 30\n",
    "     city: New York\n",
    "     is_student: false\n",
    "     languages:\n",
    "       - English\n",
    "       - Spanish\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `name`, `age`, `city`, `is_student`, and `languages` are keys, each associated with a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Nested Key-Value Pairs:**\n",
    "   - YAML supports nesting key-value pairs within other key-value pairs. This is achieved through proper indentation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     person:\n",
    "       name: Alice\n",
    "       age: 25\n",
    "       address:\n",
    "         street: 123 Main St\n",
    "         city: Wonderland\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this case, `person` is a key with a value that is a mapping containing `name`, `age`, and `address` keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value pairs play a crucial role in structuring data in YAML, providing a human-readable and flexible format for configuration files, data exchange, and various other use cases. Understanding the syntax and rules associated with key-value pairs is essential for working effectively with YAML."

    "In YAML, indentation and block structures are key aspects that determine the structure and hierarchy of data within a document. YAML uses indentation to represent nesting and relationships between data elements. Understanding these concepts is crucial for creating well-formed and readable YAML documents. Here's an explanation of indentation and block structures in YAML:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indentation:**\n",
    "   - YAML uses spaces (not tabs) for indentation.\n",
    "   - The number of spaces for each level of indentation is typically consistent throughout the document. Common choices are 2 or 4 spaces.\n",
    "   - Indentation is used to define the structure and nesting of data elements.\n",
    "   - Nested elements are indented to the right of their parent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   key1:\n",
    "     key2:\n",
    "       key3: value\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `key1` has a nested key-value pair (`key2`), and `key2` has a nested key-value pair (`key3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Block Structures:**\n",
    "   - Block structures in YAML are used to represent sequences (lists) and mappings (dictionaries).\n",
    "   - Sequences are denoted by a hyphen (`-`) followed by a space, and they represent an ordered list of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     fruits:\n",
    "       - apple\n",
    "       - banana\n",
    "       - orange\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Mappings consist of key-value pairs and are represented using indentation. The colon (`:`) separates the key and the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     person:\n",
    "       name: John Doe\n",
    "       age: 30\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Sequences and mappings can be nested to create more complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     employees:\n",
    "       - name: Alice\n",
    "         position: Manager\n",
    "       - name: Bob\n",
    "         position: Developer\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `employees` is a list of mappings where each employee has a name and position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalars and Multiline Blocks:**\n",
    "   - Scalars (single values like strings, numbers, and booleans) do not require explicit block indicators. They can be written as simple key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     name: John Doe\n",
    "     age: 25\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Multiline blocks are used for long strings or more complex content. They can be represented using the \"folded\" (`>`) or \"literal\" (`|`) style.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     description: >\n",
    "       This is a long description\n",
    "       that spans multiple lines\n",
    "       in a folded block.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     content: |\n",
    "       This is a literal block\n",
    "       where newlines are preserved exactly\n",
    "       as they are written.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The choice between folded and literal styles depends on whether you want to preserve newlines or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the relationship between indentation, block structures, and key-value pairs is essential for creating valid and readable YAML documents. Proper indentation ensures clarity and accuracy in representing the hierarchical structure of data."

    "In YAML, there are three primary types of structures used to represent data: scalars, sequences, and mappings. Understanding how these structures work is essential for creating well-structured and readable YAML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalars:**\n",
    "   - Scalars represent single, atomic values such as strings, numbers, booleans, or null.\n",
    "   - Scalars do not require explicit indicators, and YAML will automatically infer the data type.\n",
    "   - Examples of scalars:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     name: John Doe        # String scalar\n",
    "     age: 30              # Integer scalar\n",
    "     is_student: false    # Boolean scalar\n",
    "     height: 1.75         # Float scalar\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sequences:**\n",
    "   - Sequences represent ordered lists of values.\n",
    "   - Sequences are denoted by using a hyphen (`-`) followed by a space.\n",
    "   - Elements in a sequence can be of any data type, including other sequences or mappings.\n",
    "   - Examples of sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     fruits:\n",
    "       - apple\n",
    "       - banana\n",
    "       - orange\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     employees:\n",
    "       - Alice\n",
    "       - Bob\n",
    "       - Charlie\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the first example, `fruits` is a mapping with a sequence as its value. In the second example, `employees` is a mapping with a sequence of strings as its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mappings:**\n",
    "   - Mappings represent collections of key-value pairs.\n",
    "   - Mappings are denoted by using a colon (`:`) to separate the key and value.\n",
    "   - Mappings can be nested to create complex data structures.\n",
    "   - Examples of mappings:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     person:\n",
    "       name: John Doe\n",
    "       age: 30\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     employees:\n",
    "       alice: manager\n",
    "       bob: developer\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the first example, `person` is a mapping with keys `name` and `age`. In the second example, `employees` is a mapping with string keys (`alice` and `bob`) and string values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these structures—scalars, sequences, and mappings—can be combined and nested to represent a wide range of data in a human-readable and concise way. Understanding the rules for indentation and how these structures interact is crucial for creating valid YAML documents."

    "- `friends` is a sequence of mappings, where each friend has a name, age, student status, and favorite fruits.\n",
