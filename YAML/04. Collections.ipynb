    "In YAML, collections are structures used to group and organize data. There are three primary types of collections in YAML: sequences, mappings, and scalars. These collections allow you to represent complex data structures in a human-readable and concise format.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequences:**\n",
    "   - Sequences represent ordered lists of values.\n",
    "   - Elements in a sequence are denoted by a hyphen (`-`) followed by a space.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     fruits:\n",
    "       - apple\n",
    "       - banana\n",
    "       - orange\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `fruits` is a key with a sequence of three items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mappings:**\n",
    "   - Mappings represent collections of key-value pairs.\n",
    "   - Key-value pairs in a mapping are denoted by using a colon (`:`) to separate the key and value.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     person:\n",
    "       name: John Doe\n",
    "       age: 30\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `person` is a key with a mapping as its value. The mapping contains keys `name` and `age` with their respective values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalars:**\n",
    "   - Scalars represent single, atomic values such as strings, numbers, booleans, or null.\n",
    "   - Scalars do not require explicit indicators, and YAML will automatically infer the data type.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     name: John Doe\n",
    "     age: 30\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `name` and `age` are keys with string and integer scalar values, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Nested Collections:**\n",
    "   - YAML allows nesting of collections within other collections.\n",
    "   - Sequences can contain mappings or other sequences, and mappings can contain sequences, mappings, or scalars.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     complex_structure:\n",
    "       - fruits:\n",
    "           - apple\n",
    "           - banana\n",
    "       - person:\n",
    "           name: Alice\n",
    "           age: 25\n",
    "       - value: 42\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `complex_structure` is a sequence containing items of different types, including a mapping and a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implicit and Explicit Typing:**\n",
    "   - YAML can implicitly infer the data type of scalar values, sequences, and mappings. However, explicit typing with tags is also possible.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     explicit_types:\n",
    "       age: !!str 30   # Explicit string\n",
    "       pi: !!float 3.14  # Explicit float\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections in YAML provide a flexible and expressive way to structure and represent data. The choice of using sequences, mappings, or scalars depends on the nature of the data and the desired hierarchical organization. Understanding how to work with and nest these collections is fundamental to creating well-formed and readable YAML documents."

    "In YAML, tags are a mechanism for explicitly specifying the data type of a value. They provide a way to control the interpretation of a scalar, sequence, or mapping and override YAML's default type inference. Tags are useful when you want to ensure that a value is interpreted in a specific way or when you want to represent complex data types explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for a tag is `!<tag_handle>!<tag_uri>`, where `<tag_handle>` is a shorthand alias for a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that defines the tag's meaning. Commonly used tag handles include `!!` for the primary tag repository and `!` for the default repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of using tags in YAML:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Scalars:**\n",
    "   - Use tags to explicitly specify the data type of a scalar value.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     age: !!str 30   # Explicitly specifying age as a string\n",
    "     pi: !!float 3.14  # Explicitly specifying pi as a float\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `!!str` and `!!float` tags indicate that the values should be interpreted as strings and floats, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explicit Sequences:**\n",
    "   - Tags can be used to explicitly define the data type of sequence elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     numbers: !!set\n",
    "       - 1\n",
    "       - 2\n",
    "       - 3\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the `!!set` tag indicates that the sequence should be treated as a set, which typically means unordered and with unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explicit Mappings:**\n",
    "   - Tags can also be used to specify the data type of mapping values.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     person: !!omap\n",
    "       name: Alice\n",
    "       age: 25\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `!!omap` tag indicates that the mapping should be interpreted as an ordered map, preserving the order of key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Shorthand Tags:**\n",
    "   - YAML also supports shorthand tags without a handle for common data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     quantity: !int 42\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this case, `!int` is a shorthand tag indicating that the value should be treated as an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags in YAML are optional, and the language provides default rules for inferring data types. However, using tags allows you to be explicit about the intended interpretation of your data, especially when dealing with complex or custom types. It's important to note that the interpretation of tags depends on the application or system reading the YAML data, so both the writer and the reader need to understand the agreed-upon tags."
