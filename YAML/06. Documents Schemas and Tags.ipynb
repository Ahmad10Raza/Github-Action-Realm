    "In YAML, a document refers to a single YAML stream, which can contain one or more data structures. A YAML document is often associated with a single file, but it's important to note that a YAML document is not limited to a single key-value structure. Documents allow you to represent multiple independent pieces of data in a single YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key concepts related to documents in YAML:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Separation:**\n",
    "   - YAML documents are separated by three hyphens (`---`) at the beginning of a line.\n",
    "   - The three hyphens indicate the start of a new document within the same YAML stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   # Document 1\n",
    "   key1: value1\n",
    "   key2: value2\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   # Document 2\n",
    "   key3: value3\n",
    "   key4: value4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, there are two YAML documents separated by `---`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single Document:**\n",
    "   - A YAML file can contain a single document without the need for explicit document separators.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   key1: value1\n",
    "   key2: value2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is a single-document YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Documents:**\n",
    "   - A YAML file can contain multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   # Document 1\n",
    "   key1: value1\n",
    "   key2: value2\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   # Document 2\n",
    "   key3: value3\n",
    "   key4: value4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, there are two documents in a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parsing Multiple Documents:**\n",
    "   - When parsing YAML, an application or tool can process each document separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import yaml\n",
    "\n",
    "   with open('multi_documents.yaml', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       documents = list(yaml.safe_load_all(file))\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(documents)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `safe_load_all` function is used to parse all documents in a YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stream of Documents:**\n",
    "   - A sequence of documents is referred to as a YAML stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   # Document 1\n",
    "   key1: value1\n",
    "   key2: value2\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   # Document 2\n",
    "   key3: value3\n",
    "   key4: value4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This sequence of documents forms a YAML stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Document Root:**\n",
    "   - Each document in a YAML stream has its own root-level data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   # Document 1\n",
    "   person:\n",
    "     name: John Doe\n",
    "     age: 30\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   # Document 2\n",
    "   fruits:\n",
    "     - apple\n",
    "     - banana\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `person` and `fruits` are the root-level data structures of the two documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple documents in a single YAML file is particularly useful when you want to represent related but independent pieces of data together. Applications or tools that process YAML streams can iterate through the documents individually, making it a flexible way to organize information."

    "In YAML, schemas and tags are concepts related to specifying the data types of values and controlling the interpretation of YAML documents. They provide a way to define and enforce constraints on the types of data allowed in a YAML document. Let's explore each of these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schemas:**\n",
    "   - A YAML schema defines the expected structure and data types within a YAML document.\n",
    "   - Schemas can be used to enforce rules for the overall document or for specific elements like scalars, sequences, and mappings.\n",
    "   - Schemas are typically associated with validation and can be used to ensure that a YAML document adheres to a specific structure.\n",
    "   - Several schemas are available for YAML, including the JSON Schema, which is commonly used for validating YAML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example using JSON Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   # YAML document\n",
    "   person:\n",
    "     name: John Doe\n",
    "     age: 30\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   JSON Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"type\": \"object\",\n",
    "     \"properties\": {\n",
    "       \"person\": {\n",
    "         \"type\": \"object\",\n",
    "         \"properties\": {\n",
    "           \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n",
    "           \"age\": { \"type\": \"integer\" }\n",
    "         },\n",
    "         \"required\": [\"name\", \"age\"]\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     },\n",
    "     \"required\": [\"person\"]\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the JSON Schema defines an object with a `person` property, which is itself an object with `name` and `age` properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tags:**\n",
    "   - Tags are used to explicitly specify the data type of a value in a YAML document.\n",
    "   - Tags are written using the `!<tag_handle>!<tag_uri>` syntax, where `<tag_handle>` is a shorthand alias for a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that defines the tag's meaning.\n",
    "   - Tags can be used to override the default type inference and enforce a specific interpretation of a value.\n",
    "   - Shorthand tags without a handle (e.g., `!int`) are also commonly used for common data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example using Tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   # YAML document with tags\n",
    "   age: !str 30\n",
    "   pi: !float 3.14\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the tags `!str` and `!float` explicitly specify that the values should be interpreted as strings and floats, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both schemas and tags provide mechanisms to control and define the expected structure and types of data in YAML documents. Schemas are typically used for validation at a higher level, while tags offer a more fine-grained control over the interpretation of individual values. The choice between using schemas and tags depends on the specific requirements of your application or use case."
