    "CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, two fundamental concepts in DevOps and MLOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: This is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. The main goals of CI are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: This is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment. The main goals of CD are to ensure a rapid delivery of products, improve productivity, and reduce the time to market for new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), these concepts are applied to the development and deployment of machine learning models. CI/CD in MLOps ensures that ML models are consistently integrated and deployed in a reliable, automated manner."
